## Intro about the AI Model
Meta’s Llama 3, the next iteration of the open-access Llama family, is now released and available at Hugging Face. 
It's great to see Meta continuing its commitment to open AI, 
and we’re excited to fully support the launch with comprehensive integration in the Hugging Face ecosystem.

Llama 3 comes in two sizes: 8B for efficient deployment and development on consumer-size GPU, and 70B for large-scale AI native applications. 
Both come in base and instruction-tuned variants. 
In addition to the 4 models, a new version of Llama Guard was fine-tuned on Llama 3 8B and is released as Llama Guard 2 (safety fine-tune).
