## Intro about the AI Model
Gemma is a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open models from Google, built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models. 
They are text-to-text, decoder-only large language models, available in English, with open weights, pre-trained variants, and instruction-tuned variants. 
Gemma models are well-suited for a variety of text generation tasks, including question answering, summarization, and reasoning. 
Their relatively small size makes it possible to deploy them in environments with limited resources such as a laptop, 
desktop or your own cloud infrastructure, democratizing access to state of the art AI models and helping foster innovation for everyone.
