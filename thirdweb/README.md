## Getting Started

Create a project using this example:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --template next-javascript-starter
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

On `pages/_app.js`, you'll find our `ThirdwebProvider` wrapping your app, this is necessary for our hooks to work.

on `pages/index.js`, you'll find the `useMetamask` hook that we use to connect the user's wallet to MetaMask, `useDisconnect` that we use to disconnect it, and `useAddress` to check the user's wallet address once connected.
