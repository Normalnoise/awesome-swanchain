This data visualization project showcases a tool for exploring over 80K reports of UFO sightings around the world collected from 1906 - 2014. The original project page is [here](https://github.com/wlouie1/UFO-Sightings).

The project was built using vanilla JS/HTML/CSS, and a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/wlouie1/ufo-data-vis) was created to bundle a simple Nginx server to serve the static files. The `deploy.yaml` uses this docker image to very easily deploy the app on Akash.
